Running tests
=============

Wand has unit tests and regression tests.  It can be run using
:file:`setup.py` script:

.. sourcecode:: console

   $ python setup.py test

It uses pytest_ as its testing library.  The above command will automatically
install pytest as well if it's not installed yet.

Or you can manually install pytest and then use :program:`py.test` command.
It provides more options:

.. sourcecode:: console

   $ pip install pytest
   $ py.test

.. _pytest: http://pytest.org/


Skipping tests
--------------

There are some time-consuming tests.  You can skip these tests using
``--skip-slow`` option:

.. sourcecode:: console

   $ py.test --skip-slow

You can run only tests you want using ``-k`` option.

.. sourcecode:: console

   $ py.test -k image


Using tox_
----------

Wand should be compatible with various Python implementations including
CPython 2.6, 2.7, PyPy.  tox_ is a testing software that helps Python
packages to test on various Python implementations at a time.

It can be installed using :program:`easy_install` or :program:`pip`:

.. sourcecode:: console

   $ easy_install tox

If you type just :program:`tox` at Wand directory it will be tested
on multiple Python interpreters:

.. sourcecode:: console

   $ tox
   GLOB sdist-make: /Users/dahlia/Desktop/wand/setup.py
   py26 create: /Users/dahlia/Desktop/wand/.tox/py26
   py26 installdeps: pytest
   py26 sdist-inst: /Users/dahlia/Desktop/wand/.tox/dist/Wand-0.2.2.zip
   py26 runtests: commands[0]
   ...

You can use a double ``--`` to pass options to pytest:

.. sourcecode:: console

   $ tox -- -k sequence

.. _tox: http://tox.testrun.org/
